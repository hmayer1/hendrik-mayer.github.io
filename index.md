Welcome! I am Hendrik Mayer, a second-year PhD student working in the [GeMS Lab](https://gemslab.github.io/) led by Danai Koutra, focusing on representation learning and graph neural networks.

Before that, I obtained my MEng in Computer Science and BS in Computer Science and Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2024 and 2023 respectively.

My research interests are representation learning, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and generally machine learning!
